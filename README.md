# Basa
A base framework combining a bunch of useful plugins, animation mixins, plus Foundation responsive grid.

## How to use

The demo page is a kitchen sink, but the framework is designed to be pulled apart and only use the parts you want. Aside from the main variables.scss and settings.scss files, each part has its own, self-contained SCSS file.

The plugins don't rely on any dependencies (like jQuery) so they can be used separately. Standalone examples of the plugins can be found in /components/ folder.

## To do
This is a work in progress. I'm always adding best-practices and common patterns to my arsenal. 
All feedback appreciated!
